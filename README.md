# Multiple Kernelized Correlation Filters based Track-Before-Detect Algorithm for Tracking Weak and Extended Target in Marine Radar Systems

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)   
This is the **python** implementation of the - 
[Multiple Kernelized Correlation Filters based Track-Before-Detect Algorithm for Tracking Weak and Extended Target in Marine Radar Systems](https://).

<!---[Source paper](https://) of the preprint version.--->

## Introduction
We have extended [MKCF](https://github.com/joeyee/MKCF/) to track weak target in 
the framework of multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD). 
Now the source paper is under the second review. 

Simulated Rayleigh and K distributed sea clutter with varied
PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) are given in the file []().


## Requirements
- python - 3.9.1
- scipy  - 1.6.0
- opencv-python - 4.5.1
- PIL    - 8.1.0

## How to use the code

### Step 1
